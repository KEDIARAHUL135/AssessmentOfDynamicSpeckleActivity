# Assessment of dynamic Speckle-activity of fevicol with time

This project aims to assess the dynamic speckle-activity of fevicol with time as the fevicol dries out. 

From the speckle images this code can compute the Time History of the Speckle Pattern (THSP), Co-occurrence Matrix (COM), Inertia Moment (IM), Absolute Value of the Differences (AVD), SM Index, Contrast, Homogeneity, Angular Second Moment, Generalized Difference Method (GD), Fujii Method (F), Alternative Fujii Method (F<sub>al</sub>), Parameterized GD (PGD), Alternative GD (AGD), and Parameterized Global Average Fujii (PGAF).
